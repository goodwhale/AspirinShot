# AspirinShot

Create your App Store screenshots in SwiftUI:
* 🛠️ in Xcode
* ✌️ using your #SwiftUI and #UIKit views
* 🙅 no UITests
* 🌐 Localized w/Strings.file

AspirinShot is free to test and evaluate, you can take all the time you need to create your screenshots with it.
Once you're ready to export your screenshots without watermark, please purchase a license.

> 🚧 Beta Warning: The documentation is incomplete. Please bear with me while I update this page and the code documentation. 😅
